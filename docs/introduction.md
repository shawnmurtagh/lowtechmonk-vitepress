# The Circle and the Current: Why We Need a Cyber Wisdom Framework

There was a time when a tool was a stone in our hand, a bow in our grip, or a net in our calloused fingers.  
We knew what it could do because we knew how it was made, and we knew the one who made it.  
The danger was plain — a blade could cut us, a fire could burn — but both kept us alive.  
The decision was ours,  
and the weight of that decision sat in our chests like a stone we could feel.  

Today, the tools are invisible.  
They arrive not with the sound of footsteps on the path,  
but with a vibration in your pocket or a glow on your desk.  
They ask for nothing but your attention.  
They smile with their silver tongues,  
promising connection, productivity, and knowledge —  
but they do not tell you what they take in return.  

We need a way to see through this fog.  
Not to reject all technology,  
but to meet it in a way that keeps our circle whole.  
We need cyber wisdom —  
a set of roots deep in natural thinking,  
so that no matter how fast the river runs,  
we do not lose our footing on the stones beneath.  

## The Three Circles

### Self

The first fire you must tend is your own.
If you do not guard your mind, you will mistake noise for truth.
A cyber wisdom framework gives you questions to ask before you let a new tool into your life:

- Does this serve my values, or does it serve itself?
- Will it help me grow, or will it make me more dependent?
- Can I walk away from it, or will it pull me back with invisible strings?

Without such questions, you are no longer the hunter — you are the hunted.

### Family

In a family, the circle is wider.
A child’s eyes are quick to trust the bright colors, the smooth voices, the endless scroll.
But trust given without wisdom is an open door for the friend and enemy alike.

A cyber wisdom framework helps a family decide together:
When do we welcome the tool into our home?
When do we keep it outside the firelight?
When do we say no — not because the thing is evil,
but because we know we are not ready to carry its weight?

Children learn not just from what we tell them,
but from the boundaries we keep.
When we choose with care, we teach them to do the same.

### Community

It takes a village to raise a village: its survival depends on trust.
Technology can strengthen that trust,
but it can also hollow it out until only the image remains.
The tools we use to measure success can quietly change the meaning of success.
The tools we use to protect our people can quietly watch them instead.

A cyber wisdom framework in an organization  
asks more than “Does this make us faster?”  
It asks: “Does this make us stronger?  
Does this keep our fire burning,  
or does it slowly make us its slave?"  

## The Way of the Low Tech Monk

### 5 Symbols

The low tech monk uses five symbols to light our way.  

<span style="color: #FF4500; font-weight: bold;">Fire</span> - meaning, purpose, human experience, that which provides warmth  
<span style="color: #FFD700; font-weight: bold;">Circle</span> - family, friendship, relationships to all living things, as things enter the circle, we keep them on the outside until we are able to harness them to grow the fire  
<span style="color: #708090; font-weight: bold;">Knife</span> - a tool, the potential to help and hurt, neutral  
<span style="color: #8B4513; font-weight: bold;">Stone</span> - a memory, space imbued with time, a moment captured  
<span style="color: #1E90FF; font-weight: bold;">Song</span> - an expression, an action, a way to celebrate what we have and invite the others
