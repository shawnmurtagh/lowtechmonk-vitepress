# Exercise 1: Light your Fire

We begin with fire. Our ancestors knew fire as a source of warmth, light, and protection. The Low Tech Monk realizes he or she must also identify that fire which gives their life meaning, purpose, and warmth.  

Finding that fire is the first step to building a cyber wisdom framework. Once you have identified your fire, you can begin to build a circle around it, a circle of trust that will help you grow and protect that fire, and the loved ones who gather around it.
