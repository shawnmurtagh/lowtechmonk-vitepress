# The Way of the Low Tech Monk

A monk does not hate the world â€” he simply refuses to be ruled by it.
The lowtechmonk way is the same.
We do not reject the river, but we do not let it carry us away.
We walk the bank. We choose when to enter.
We decide which crossings are worth the risk.

Technology is not the enemy.
Forgetfulness is the enemy.
The moment we stop deciding with care,
the moment we let the tools decide for us,
that is when the landslide begins.

But a rooted way-of-life, guided by cyber wisdom,
can stand against the rush.
We can choose what to take into the circle.
We can keep the fire burning.
And we can pass down not just the tools,
but the wisdom to wield them.
